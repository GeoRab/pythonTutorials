      "\n",
      "In particular, `.sum()` is a **method** belonging to the `DataFrame` **class**. This is where definitions can get confusing, because they all sort of reference each other. Here's a rough and tumble guide to keeping them straight:\n",

      " - A class is a blueprint for something called an instance. Your bike is an instance; the class is the set of specifications used to build it.\n",
      " - Not every bike is identical, even if they're the same model. Yours might be a stock blue, and someone else's might be green. Maybe someone else raised the seat. That is, objects have **attributes**, and each instance of an object has their own.\n",
      " - Methods associated with the class perform operations. Frequently, these operations rely on some data attribute of the class instance. `andrewsBike.getColor()` might tell you the color of Andrew's bike. Call `andrewsBike.setColor(\"blue\")`, and you might have just painted his bike.\n",
